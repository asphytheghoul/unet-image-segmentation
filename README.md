This is a U-NET model which uses a combination of convolutional layers and Conv2d transpose layers built using keras trained on the data science bowl 2018 competition.
Image segmentation is generally an important step in analyzing microscopic areas in an image such as cells in a microscope slide or certain pixels in an image. Segmentation is an important stage of the image recognition system, because it extracts the objects of our interest, for further processing such as description or recognition. Segmentation of an image is in practice for the classification of image pixel.
